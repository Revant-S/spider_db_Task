# Database Task
In this Task I have used mongodb dataBase which is a noSql database. 
# To test the commands 
- install mongodb on the machine

  ```bash
  mongosh
This will open the mongoDb interactive shell
-Then the commands can be just copied and pasted on the terminal for rest of the test.
-it created total 20 entries and performs the operations given in the task on the collection accordingly
